<h2>Customer satisfaction is a differentiator in some industries, says ACSI Funds’ Kevin Quigg</h2>

 <p>Stock pickers tend to screen companies for metrics including price-to-earnings ratios, analysts’ earnings estimates and profit margins.</p> <p>But there’s a simpler approach in this long period of technological transformation that is threatening industries from retail to banking: customer satisfaction.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p> <strong>See:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-investors-should-pay-attention-to-this-two-digit-number-2017-05-12" class="icon none" >Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer</a> </p> <p>The American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/acsi">(ACSI)</a>
 comprises about 170 mostly large-cap stocks that are selected according to American Customer Satisfaction Index scores. Stocks are allocated so that each sector is weighted within 10%, up or down, of that sector’s market-capitalization weighting in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
</p> <p>As internet retail giant Amazon.com Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
 expands into more businesses, pleasing customers may be the most important factor for companies looking to survive the onslaught. </p> <p>When discussing fundamental stock research in an interview July 26, ACSI Funds chief strategist Kevin Quigg said financial results reported by companies “are in no way forward looking.” Measuring how people feel about companies “is a better forward indicator of future behavior and success,” he said. </p>

<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/stt">(STT)</a>
 heading the SPDR ETFs’ global sales strategy, as well as its global capital markets and institutional ETF sales groups.   </p> <p>The American Customer Satisfaction Index was developed in 1994 by researchers at the University of Michigan, led by Claes Fornell, working with the American Society for Quality in Milwaukee, and CFI Group in Ann Arbor, Mich. Fornell is now the Distinguished Donald C. Cook Emeritus Professor of Business at the university. </p> <p>The index measures the level of customer satisfaction of about 300 companies in 43 industries doing business in the U.S., based on surveys of about 180,000 people. Fornell is chairman of ACSI Funds.</p> <p>The American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF was launched in November, and MarketWatch’s Ryan Vlastelica <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/customers-love-these-companies-but-should-investors-love-the-satisfaction-etf-2016-11-07" class="icon none" >described the fund at that time</a> after interviewing ACSI Funds CEO Phil Bak. </p> <p>Soon after the fund was established, Apple Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 was its largest holding, making up 3.4% of the portfolio, while Amazon accounted for only 0.4%. As of the stock market’s close July 26, Amazon was the biggest holding, representing 3.4% of the portfolio, with Apple second, at 3%, and Alphabet Inc.’s Class C shares 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog">(GOOG)</a>
 in third place at 2.1%.</p> <p>Quigg said Amazon had climbed to the top of the list because of “a few alterations to the methodology to better align our industries with investment industry norms,” and to give more weighting to companies with the highest levels of customer satisfaction in their industries. </p> <h6>Immune to Amazon?</h6> <p>Quigg disagreed with some of the conclusions by Jefferies Equity Research analysts who said in a report last week that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/attention-shoppers-amazon-effect-is-creating-bargain-stocks-2017-07-19" class="icon none" >the decline in stock prices for various competitors of Amazon had created some bargains for investors</a>.</p> <p>For example, Advance Auto Parts 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aap">(AAP)</a>
 is rated “buy” by Jefferies, and its stock is down 37% this year through July 26. But Quigg said competing auto-parts and accessories retailer AutoZone Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/azo">(AZO)</a>
 which Jefferies rates “hold,” has a higher level of customer satisfaction — a score of 80 versus 79 for Advance Auto Parts. AutoZone has fallen a bit less this year, by 35%.</p> <p>Another stock singled out as a bargain by the Jefferies team was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/wmt">(WMT)</a>
 which Quigg called a “perennially low scorer.” Wal-Mart’s current ACSI score is 72, and “for reference,” Quigg said the score for Costco Wholesale Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cost">(COST)</a>
 is 83. Still, Wal-Mart’s stock is up 15.6% this year, and Costco is little changed. </p> <p>The retail winner is Amazon — “perennially a leader,” he said. It’s currently at 86, up from 83 a year ago. Sure enough, the company’s stock has soared in 2017, by 40%, making CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s richest man (briefly) this week.</p> <p>So the American Customer Satisfaction Index obviously can’t pick winners every time. Still, 18 of the ETF’s top 25 holdings have increased in value this year, two are little changed and five have declined. The biggest loser is U.S. Cellular Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/usm">(USM)</a>
 down 13%.</p> <h6>Survival methods</h6> <p>Quigg voiced a mild objection to the notion that certain industries, including cruise lines, hotels and restaurants, might be immune to the Amazon effect. They are not immune to losing sales to competitors who provide superior service, he said.</p> <p>Another point he made was that the internet provides hope for companies that are working hard to improve their customer service. JetBlue Airways Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/jblu">(JBLU)</a>
 is the only airline among the top 25 stocks held by the fund. There’s a perception that newer carriers provide better service than the major legacy carriers. However, since so much air-travel booking is done by people searching for the lowest prices online, the word could spread very quickly if customers become more satisfied with the way they are treated by a legacy carrier. </p> <p>This quick spreading-of-the-word online could help other companies that are threatened by new technology or the Amazon effect make relatively speedy recoveries as their service quality improves.</p> <h6>Fund performance and holdings</h6> <p>The American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF had $29 million in assets as of July 26. It has returned 8% this year, which compares with a 12% return for the S&amp;P 500 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 Of course, a track record of less than a year is very little to go on when considering a long-term investment strategy.</p> <p>ETFs report their portfolio holdings every day.

 <p>Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.</p> <p>The term stands for a quintet of the market’s most pronounced highfliers: Facebook Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
 Apple Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 Amazon.com Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
 Netflix Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx">(NFLX)</a>
 and Alphabet 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
 the parent company of Google. Together they’ve accounted for a huge amount of the overall market’s advance, something that could leave major indexes vulnerable in the event the group turns lower.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Based on their Wednesday close, the FAANG stocks have accounted for more than a quarter of the S&amp;P 500’s total year-to-date return (28.4%, to be exact), according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. That calculation doesn’t include the sharp decline that several of the stocks underwent on Thursday.</p> <p>Each of the five stocks is up sharply thus far this year, posting gains that range from about 20% to nearly 50%. Furthermore, four of the five are among the five largest stocks in the U.S. equity market, meaning they have an outsize weight on broader moves. Together, they account for more than 10% of the S&amp;P 500 by market capitalization.</p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 is up 10.6% thus far this year. The Nasdaq Composite Index 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp">(COMP)</a>
 where all of the FAANG stocks trade, has climbed 18.6%. The Nasdaq -100 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/ndx">(NDX)</a>
 which has an even more concentrated holding of the group, is up nearly 22%.</p> <p>Overall, the information-technology sector has accounted for 41.6% of the S&amp;P 500’s total return this year, per Silverblatt’s data, by far the most of any group. The tech sector 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/xlk">(XLK)</a>
 itself is up 18.9%, while the consumer-discretionary sector

 <p>Apple's brand extends far beyond technology and coolness. The company has accumulated incredible goodwill with consumers. </p> <p>So whenever Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 comes out with the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/which-company-is-winning-the-race-for-self-driving-cars-2017-06-28" class="icon none" > Apple Car</a>, it will grab a disproportionately large market share from General Motors 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gm">(GM)</a>
  and other automakers precisely because of that deep well of goodwill. By the time my youngest child, Mia Sarah, who is almost two, learns to drive, internal combustion engines will likely be a relic consigned to museums (just like Ford’s Model T).</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>I had this “Aha!” moment recently when I visited a Tesla 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla">(TSLA)</a>
 store and saw its cars’ power train. It looks just like a skateboard — basically a flat slab of metal (which houses the battery), four wheels, and an electric engine the size of a large watermelon. That’s it — the Tesla has only 18 moving parts. </p> <p>Wall Street nowadays is going gaga over the stocks of auto dealerships (especially after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought Van Tuyl Group) and automakers. I am in the minority in thinking that party will come to an end. Just like Tesla, Apple is not going to be using a dealership model to sell its cars. Just as with the iPhone, the company will want complete control of the buying experience. </p> <p>If both Tesla and Apple bypass the dealership model, the GMs of the world will be at an even larger<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-auto-giants-are-dealing-with-a-major-threat-2017-07-05" class="icon none" > competitive disadvantage</a>. They will have to abandon the dealership model too. Yes, I know, selling cars directly to consumers is not legal in many states, but if the U.S. Constitution could be amended 27 times, the law on car sales (which is an artifact of the Great Depression) can be amended as well. The traditional dealership model is unlikely to survive anyway, as its economics dramatically degrade in the electric-car world. A car with few moving parts and minimal electronics has few things to break. Consequently, electric cars will need <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/beyond-tesla-7-stocks-driving-the-autonomous-car-revolution-2017-07-19" class="icon none" >less servicing</a>, throttling the dealerships’ most important profit center. </p>

  </figcaption>
</figure> <p>What is also amazing about electric cars is that they aren’t that much different from smartphones. Smartphone prices have declined significantly because their components became ubiquitous and commoditized. The simplicity of electric cars and the declining ambition of Tesla, Apple, and whoever else enters that space to be known as a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-drops-hints-about-its-work-on-a-self-driving-car-2016-12-03" class="icon none" >“car” company </a>will likely lead to commoditization of components and thus lower prices. Tesla today is more a software and battery company than a car company. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Think back to the day when Apple introduced the iPhone. No one suspected that it (and the smartphones that followed) would enable a service like Uber, which is putting cabdrivers worldwide out of business.</p> <p>The baby boomer generation romanticizes cars. Most boomers can recite the horsepower and other engine specs of every car they have ever owned. For the tail end of Gen-X (my generation) and Millennials, a car is an interruption between Facebook 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
 and Twitter 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twtr">(TWTR)</a>
 . We know the brand of speakers in our car but if asked would have to Google its horsepower. We feel little romanticism for our cars and have much higher brand loyalty to Apple and Google 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
 than to GM or Ford Motor 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/f">(F)</a>
  </p> <p>When Apple <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/cook-says-apple-is-focusing-on-making-an-autonomous-car-system"  class="icon " >makes its entrance </a>into the auto industry, it will likely be successful and highly disruptive. After all, Apple has the much-needed software know-how to design a car. (Apple is already working with car companies on CarPlay, the iPhone-centered car infotainment system.) Apple boasts a global network of stores, possesses unlimited resources ($150 billion of net cash and $50 billion of free cash flows annually), and its imagination has not been damaged by decades of producing cars with internal combustion engines. </p> 
<aside>
    General Motors’ answer to Tesla has been no different from Nokia’s response to the iPhone.
    <cite></cite>
</aside>
 <p>Let me stress that last point. There is a good reason why Nokia, which at one time was the dominant cellphone manufacturer, failed to compete with the iPhone. It had too much institutional knowledge. Nokia had hundreds of engineers who tried to add IQ to a dumb phone. The company was attempting to convert Symbian, a dumb-phone operating system, into a smartphone operating system. Despite Apple showing Nokia how the smartphone should look, the company couldn’t see its product as a smartphone but rather just as the next iteration of a dumb phone. </p> <p>General Motors’ answer to Tesla has been no different from Nokia’s response to the iPhone. GM came out with the Chevy Volt, which was really one of its internal combustion engine (ICE) cars with an electric engine dumped in. Unless an ICE car company creates a silo unit isolated from the rest of the operation, it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to get engineers who have designed ICE vehicles all their lives to change their thinking and turn into electric-car engineers.</p> <p> <em>So, how does one invest in this overvalued market?

In June, a company executive identified the seven as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.</p> <p>In addition to Wisconsin, Foxconn is looking in the Detroit area for a possible plant, two people familiar with the plans said.

 <p>Major U.S. stock-market indexes are trading near records, and more investors are finding that unsettling.</p> <p>About 36% of investment managers find the U.S. stock market undervalued or fairly valued at current levels, according to a quarterly investment manager survey performed by Northern Trust Asset Management. That’s the lowest reading in the history of the survey, which began in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Nearly two-thirds of investors—65%—say the U.S. equity market is overvalued, the highest percentage on record.</p> <p>The survey was conducted over a period that ended June 22. The S&amp;P 500 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 is up 1.5% since then.</p> <p>Concerns have been growing over the valuation of the U.S. market, which by one estimation <a rel="nofollow" href="Major%20U.S.%20stock-market%20indexes%20are%20trading%20near%20record%20levels,%20and%20more%20and%20more%20investors%20are%20finding%20that%20troubling."  class="icon " >is the priciest on the planet</a>. However, the picture isn’t completely bearish. The market’s recent gains have occurred against a backdrop of improving corporate earnings, a strong labor market, and positive—albeit tepid—economic growth.</p> <p>“Although managers view U.S. equity valuations as extended, fundamentals—GDP growth, low inflation and earnings growth—are still favorable,” Christopher Vella, chief investment officer for multi-manager solutions at Northern Trust Asset Management said in a news release. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>The survey indicated that 60% of respondents expect U.S. economic growth to remain stable in the near-term future, though only 29% expect it to accelerate, down from the 44% maintaining that view in the previous survey. As far as positioning goes, 33% of managers surveyed became more risk averse over the past quarter, an above-average level, while only 4% became less risk averse, compared with 14% in the previous survey. More than 60% of managers polled didn’t change their portfolio’s risk profile over the past quarter, and 82% reported cash levels that were unchanged from the first quarter.</p> <p> <strong>Read:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tug-of-war-between-bulls-and-bears-is-keeping-stock-market-in-check-2017-02-07" class="icon none" >Tug of war between bulls and bears is keeping the stock market in check</a> </p> <p>Experts have recently been <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/miss-the-bull-market-investors-say-the-next-one-will-be-overseas-2017-05-09" class="icon none" >encouraging investors to look overseas for the next leg higher</a>, and that view held in Northern Trust’s survey. While only 36% of managers view the U.S. as undervalued, 86% feel that way about European stocks, and 88% view emerging market equities as undervalued or fairly valued.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 has hit a series of records thus far in 2017, and it is up more than 10% on the year. A good chunk of the gains—and a big reason that there are general concerns over valuation—have come on the so-called FAANG stocks, a group that includes the technology stocks Facebook 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
 Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 and Google parent Alphabet 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
 as well as the consumer discretionary names Amazon.com 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
 and Netflix Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx">(NFLX)</a>
 </p> <p>These names implicitly came up in the survey, as only 6% of respondents considered consumer staples undervalued, while 15% said the same of technology. A much higher percentage thought there was further room to grow in both financial stocks, where 39% said the group was undervalued, as well as energy and health care, sectors where 32% said they were cheap or fairly valued.</p> <p>The divergence between the market’s most and least expensive is unusually high, and that can cloud the outlook for the broader market. According to the Boston Company, an asset manager, the difference in the price-to-book ratios—one measure of equity valuations—for the market’s most-expensive and least-expensive quintile is around 10, an unusually high level.</p>

 <p>That divergence indicates there are values to be had outside of the trading favorites that have been seeing meteoric growth of late. </p> <p>“There’s a real big opportunity to invest in those deeper value oriented companies. A lot of stocks look very expensive to us, even the ones that have great growth, because the market doesn’t believe we’ll have a cyclical upturn [in economic activity], so the market has been gravitating to them,” said John Bailer, senior portfolio manager at the Boston Company. “I think we’re setting ourselves up for a market that’s just OK over the next five years.”</p> <p> <strong>Read more:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/value-investing-a-decadelong-loser-looks-more-dormant-than-dead-2017-06-09" class="icon none" >Does tech selloff mean that value, a decadelong loser, is ready to supplant growth strategies?</a> </p>

 <p>Every time I write a column about the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-all-over-for-the-faang-stocks-2017-06-12" class="icon none" >high-flying FAANG stocks</a>, especially when I compare them with the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/millennials-are-making-the-same-dumb-investing-mistakes-their-parents-did-2017-07-11" class="icon none" >internet bubble of the late 1990s</a>, I get the same response from Kool-Aid-drinking readers: These companies make lots of money; the dot-coms didn’t, so there’s a reason these stocks can keep going higher. </p> <p>Aside from being a variation on the old theme, “this time is different,” this argument for Facebook

<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
) has the additional virtue of being spectacularly wrong. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Investors who have short memories may be thinking of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/technology/1003/gallery.dot_com_busts/10.html"  class="icon " >the most egregious failures of that benighted era</a>: Kozmo.com and Webvan, TheGlobe.com and eToys, and, most notorious of all, Pets.com.</p> <p>But those companies, which were indeed huge money losers, had minuscule market caps; they couldn’t remotely drive the Nasdaq Composite Index
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp">(COMP)</a>
  down 72% from its March 2000 peak to its bear-market low. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pionline.com/article/20150302/INTERACTIVE/150309989/top-15-nasdaq-companies-when-the-index-peaked-in-2000"  class="icon " >In March 2000, the Nasdaq had more than 4,700 stocks with a combined market value of $6.6 trillion</a>.</p> <p>No, the biggest winners of the dot-com era were mainstream technology companies making gobs of money. I dug up old annual reports and 10-K statements on some of the best performers and found that although some superstars like Micron Technology were in the red in 1999, the overwhelming majority were very profitable with powerful earnings growth.</p> <p>It also didn’t hurt that real GDP grew at almost 5% in 1999 and unemployment was near 4% or that companies were upgrading their systems like crazy to protect against the much-feared Y2K software bug.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Still, that didn’t save them from the terrible rout that followed; some of the biggest names and best performers lost even more than the Nasdaq did, whose collapse rivaled that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the 1930s or Japan’s Nikkei index in the 1990s. Since then, many of these former supernovas have been bought out, and very, very few are priced higher now than they were in March 2000, a long 17 years ago.</p> <p>The tables below tell the story. The first, which I compiled using historical stock data (which wasn’t readily available for all the stocks I wanted to look at) and past 10-K filings, shows the rise and subsequent fall of some of that era’s most prominent technology names. All five were among the 10 largest Nasdaq stocks by market value at the peak. In fact, Microsoft and Cisco Systems were valedictorian and salutatorian of that ill-fated class of 2000. </p> <table> <tbody> <tr class="data"> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="4">These tech highfliers of dot-com era made big money</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> </tr> <tr class="data even"> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> </tr> <tr class="data"> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">% gain from</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">% decline in</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> </tr> <tr class="data even"> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">1997-98 to</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">2000-2003</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">1998-99 EPS</td> </tr> <tr class="data"> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">Company</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">Ticker</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">1999-2000</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">bear market</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">growth</td> </tr> <tr class="data even"> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan=""></td> </tr> <tr class="data"> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">Qualcomm</td> <td id="" align="" valign="top" colspan="">

<description>Apple’s stock rallies to a seventh-straight gain, the win streak in nine months, after Morgan Stanley raised its price target.</description>

<h2>Apple stock’s win streak would be longest so far this year</h2>

 <p>Shares of Apple Inc. rose to a seventh straight gain Monday, after Morgan Stanley boosted its price target on the belief that bad news for this year could be great news for next year.</p> <p>The stock 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 rose as much as 1.2% in intraday trade before paring gains to close up 52 cents, or 0.3%, at $149.56 The current win streak is now the longest such stretch since the seven-day streak ended Oct. 12, 2016.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>The stock’s percentage gain was the fifth-biggest among the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s components, while the price gain added about points to the price of the Dow 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia">(DJIA)</a>
 which fell 8 points. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-futures-hold-steady-as-investors-get-ready-for-big-earnings-week-2017-07-17" class="icon none" >See Market Snapshot</a>.</p> <p>Analyst Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley raised her stock price target to $182, which is 22% above current levels, and 12% above the average price target -- $162.12 -- of the 44 analysts surveyed by FactSet. Huberty’s new target is now the third highest of those surveyed, behind the $202 target of Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White and the $184 target of BTIG’s Walter Piecyk, according to FactSet.</p> 

 <p> The bad news is that when Apple reports fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 1, Huberty expects the technology behemoth to provide a fourth-quarter outlook that is below Wall Street’s consensus, because Huberty expects the new iPhone be shipped slightly later than typical, in October rather than September.</p> <p> <strong>Don’t miss</strong>: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/iphone-production-issues-reportedly-threaten-apple-sales-rebound-2017-07-12" class="icon none" >IPhone production issues reportedly threaten Apple sales rebound</a>.</p>

 <p>Richard “Trip” Miller of Gullane Capital LLC, whose hedge fund generated a 78% return after fees last year, is still bullish on Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. because the tech companies’ massive cash flow enables them to easily enter new industries in search of profits.</p> <p>Still, Miller isn’t a fan of all so-called FAANG stocks: He has a short position on Netflix Inc., betting on a decline in the shares. (FAANG stands for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.)</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Miller founded Gullane Capital of Memphis, Tenn., in 2002. The firm runs $24 million in its hedge fund, Gullane Capital Partners LLC, as well as another $68 million in private accounts following the same strategy as the fund. He said all employees place their entire investible assets in the fund to align their interests with those of clients.</p> <p>The fund follows a value strategy, with a stated goal of purchasing stocks at 50% of its “appraisal,” buying more shares as prices fall, and selling as prices approach Miller’s value estimate. The fund typically has 10 to 20 long positions, but also has five to 15 short positions. For long positions, Miller said the fund seeks to hold positions for many years, “with very low turnover.”</p> <p>Gullane Capital Partners LLC had a 77.5% return during 2016, after fees, according to Convergex. The fee structure is modeled on Warren Buffett’s for the partnership he ran from 1956 to 1969: a combination of 1% of assets under management annually, plus 20% of any gains for the fund over a 6% return in a given year; if returns amount to less than 6%, investors pay only the 1% annual fee. </p> <p>Over the past three years, through Dec. 31, the fund’s average annual return, after fees, was 12.3%, compared with 8.9% for the S&amp;P 500 Index 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 For the past five years, the fund’s average annual return after fees was 11.3%, trailing the S&amp;P 500’s 14.7% gain.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <h6>History won’t repeat</h6> <p>Miller said it was important to “temper expectations” after such a strong performance in 2016, when all 18 of the fund’s long positions were up (if reinvested dividends were included). </p> <p>“We don’t expect that to happen again. I think it was the byproduct of planting the seeds in 2015 and being wrong in the fourth quarter of 2015,” he said, referring to his purchases of Wynn Resorts Ltd. shares. The fund was down 28% in 2015.</p> <p>Miller said he bought Wynn “too early,” but that the trade — then and now the fund’s largest position — worked out very well in 2016, when it rose 28%, and in 2017, when it was up 55% through July 7. This is the third time Miller’s team has invested in the casino operator.</p> <p>Miller said he is willing to invest in companies over and over. </p> <p>“We know when they are cheap, and we know when they are fully valued,” he said. </p> <p>He said it is a continual “struggle” to avoid buying or selling too early. </p> <p>“We’re never going to be great at calling bottoms,” he said.</p> <p>Here are Miller’s thoughts about six of the fund’s long positions and two of its short positions:</p> <h6>Long positions</h6> <p> <strong>Chesapeake Energy:</strong> Shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/chk">(CHK)</a>
 are down 35% this year, through July 7, after returning 56% last year, when they greatly boosted the fund’s performance. </p> <p>Miller said that even though the company has been doing “a marvelous job” reducing debt, it is “more leveraged than any other company we own or have ever owned.” He still believes Chesapeake is a good long-term investment because “the assets they have in the ground exceed those liabilities multifold.” </p> <p> <strong>Apple:</strong> Miller ties in Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 with Google and Amazon, saying high levels of free cash flow enable those companies to move into various businesses that investors may not anticipate, “many of which are home runs.”</p> <p>Miller agrees with Apple skeptics, who see plenty of risk from the company’s reliance on one product, the iPhone. But he sees a silver lining in the company’s services business. Apple’s services revenue for its fiscal second quarter rose 18% from a year earlier. Miller believes the company’s services business — including the distribution of iPhone apps, music and video — “has the potential over the next three years to become 20% to 25% of revenue for Apple.” He also sees long-term potential for the company in the networking of all sorts of appliances and equipment in homes. </p> <p> <strong>Amazon:</strong> “We have owned it for over a decade and have opportunistically added to our position over time,” Miller said. The last time he bought “materially” more shares of Amazon.com 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
 was in February 2016, following a heavy sell-off of the broader market. </p>

</figure>
 <p>Miller admires Amazon’s willingness to “probe and buy things” to enter new businesses. “If it works, wonderful. If it doesn’t work out, if they do not get the returns they want, they shut it down.”</p> <p> <strong>Disney:</strong> Walt Disney Co.’s 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dis">(DIS)</a>
 shares are flat this year, with dividends reinvested, following a 1% return in 2016. When discussing investors’ concerns over the company’s ESPN subsidiary, Miller said, there continues to be “high demand” for ESPN’s product, but that Disney needs to figure out how to distribute its sports content in an increasingly fragmented media environment.</p> <p>For the long term, Miller is confident in Disney because of its size and quality. “Could I build a similar company with $20 billion? The answer is no,” he said.</p> <p>Miller said the company’s bottom line will be improved by its growing cruise ship business and its deal to take greater control of Euro Disney.</p> <p> <strong>FedEx:</strong> Miller is impressed that Frederick W. Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fdx">(FDX)</a>
 is still its CEO, “with a lot of skin in the game.” He said that even though the stock is near its all-time high, its valuation is relatively low. The stock trades for 14 times the consensus 2018 earnings estimate, among analysts polled by FactSet, compared with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6 for the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>He expects great things from the company’s integration of the Netherlands-based TNT Express, which it acquired in May.</p> <p> <strong>McDonald’s:</strong> “We bought it for the second time a couple of years ago when it was trading below $90 a share,” at a time when it seemed consumers’ focus on healthier food would hurt McDonald’s, Miller said. The company’s “poor management” was pushing “a bad strategy” on franchisees, he said. </p> <p>Shares of McDonald’s Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mcd">(MCD)</a>
 closed at $156.27 on July 10. Miller said Steve Easterbrook, who took over as the company’s CEO in March 2015, “has done a magnificent job turning around a big ship.” </p> <p>He said the company had “done a pretty good job pivoting to the consumer. It is much healthier than it was even a few years ago.” But he also said he “would not buy more here” in light of the shares’ price increase.</p> <h6>Short positions</h6> <p>Miller attributed a great part of the fund’s success in 2016 on its short positions in retail stocks, as well as apparel and “hardline goods.” </p> <p>Even with all the pessimism about brick-and-mortar retailers in a world transformed by Amazon and other online retailers, Miller’s outlook for the industry is unusually grim. </p> <p>“We have a bias that over the next 25 years, 70% of the mall-based apparel or hardline [retailers] will go out of business,” he said. He cited Kirkland’s Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/kirk">(KIRK)</a>
 and Tuesday Morning Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tues">(TUES)</a>
 as former short trades that had worked over the past year.</p> <p>Miller went into greater detail about two non-retail short positions: </p> <p> <strong>Netflix: </strong>Shares of Netflix 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx">(NFLX)</a>
 are up 21% this year, following an 8% return last year. But the ride hasn’t been smooth:</p>

</figure>
 <p>Miller said he had shorted Netflix at “a blended $114” a share in November and December 2015, and then covered at about $90 a share in July of last year. </p> <p>“Then I made a short-term stupid error shorting Netflix at over $100 a share in the fall of last year,” he said. The shares closed at $150.18 on July 7.</p> <p>Miller said eventual market saturation in the U.S., low barriers to entry for competitors and a cash burn rate of $1.5 billion a year would all work against Netflix’s shares eventually.</p> <p>“At the end of the day, you can spend a lot of money but you need to get a return on it. It doesn’t make any sense the way it is being valued, at all,” he said.</p> <p> <strong>Royal Caribbean:</strong> Miller has shorted and covered Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rcl">(RCL)</a>
 before. This year he shorted the stock at $110. The shares closed at $109.20 on July 7.</p> <p>“During Royal Caribbean’s 25 years as a public company, it has had cumulative negative free cash flow,” Miller said. “The maintenance and growth capex [capital expenditures] that they have to spend basically leaves them with nothing,” he said.</p>

 <p>The most widely used exchange-traded fund to track the Nasdaq-100 has seen massive inflows in recent sessions, a sign that investors are moving back into the index as large-cap internet and technology shares continue to recover from a recent bout of weakness.</p> <p>Over the past day and week, the PowerShares QQQ Trust 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/qqq">(QQQ)</a>
 has seen the biggest inflows of any ETF by far, according to FactSet data. More than $1.1 billion poured into the fund over the past session, bringing its inflows over the past week to $4.35 billion.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>By comparison, the fund with the second-highest inflows over the past day—the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/vea">(VEA)</a>
—has inflows of $123.5 million. The weekly inflows were more than twice the fund with the second-highest creations, the iShares Core MSCI EAFE 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/iefa">(IEFA)</a>
 which had $1.9 billion in inflows.</p> <p>The influx of investor attention has brought the ETF’s assets up to $51.45 billion, up from a recent low of $47.38 billion on July 5.</p> <p>Those inflows have come alongside strong gains for the fund, which is on track for its fifth straight daily advance, having risen 3.7% over that period. Thus far this year, it is up more than 19%.</p> <p>Despite those gains, recent trading has been turbulent. The fund is heavily weighted toward the so-called FAANG stocks, which stands for Facebook 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
 Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 Amazon

 Netflix

 and Alphabet 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
 the parent company of Google; these stocks comprise more than a third of the portfolio. This group has also driven broad-market moves of late, first by <a rel="nofollow" href=""  class="icon " >falling sharply on concerns they have become overdone</a>, and then rebounding. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>That translated to sharp daily moves for the fund, and heavy trading. More than 1 billion shares exchanged hands in the fund over the course of June, compared with 580 million over June 2016.</p>

 <p>Who is bullying the U.S. stock market? </p> <p>It’s popular to say that Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, the PPT (Plunge Protection Team) or the Federal Reserve, because all engage in shenanigans we’ll never fully know.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>But they don’t bully the stock market. Apple does.</p> <h6>Omnipresent Apple</h6> <p>Apple Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 is one of three stocks racing to become the first trillion-dollar company. Unlike Amazon.com Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
 and Alphabet Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog">(GOOG)</a>
 (the other two contenders), Apple is the only stock to be included in all three of the following: the Nasdaq 100 Index 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/ndx">(NDX)</a>
 the S&amp;P 500 Index 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia">(DJIA)</a>
</p> <p>In fact, Apple is more than just included — it rules the roost. It is the biggest component of the Nasdaq 100 (11.6%), the S&amp;P 500 (3.6%) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (4.6%). </p>

  <figcaption>
    
    <cite>SpyETF</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
 <p>At one point, Apple was up as much as 35% this year and accounted for 10% to 20% of the 2017 returns of the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Apple is truly the big dog of the U.S. stock market. When the stock coughs, U.S. indices catch a cold. </p> <h6>Support and resistance</h6> <p>Buying or owning the Nasdaq (and, by extension, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average) without knowing what’s going on with Apple is like planning a Caribbean vacation without knowing when hurricane season is. </p> <p>For those who don’t have the time to keep up with projections for the iPhone, iPad and other product sales or read the tea levels on whether earnings will disappoint or not, and then project how Wall Street may react, here is a simple but effective way to assess Apple:</p> <p>The chart below shows some basic support and resistance levels. In mid-May, Apple ran into black trend channel resistance and peeled back. </p> 

<figure>

  <figcaption>
    
    <cite>iSPYETF</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
 <p>This trend channel is one reason why we considered the short-term upside potential for Apple, the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 to be limited. </p> <p>According to the May 21 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ispyetf.com/sign_up.php" class="icon ">Profit Radar Report:</a> &#x201C;The Nasdaq 100 may be close to where the S&amp;P 500 was in December 2016 and March 2017: at peak momentum. Stocks almost never (permanently) top at peak momentum. Therefore, the Nasdaq 100 appears to be close to a correctional period somewhat similar to what the S&amp;P experienced since March 1.&#x201D;</p> <p>Support for Apple is around $140 and $135. Currently, Apple is floating in a &#x201C;technical vacuum,&#x201D; above support and below resistance.</p> <h6>Stock seasonality</h6> <p>Apple has been on a 13-year tear, so seasonality is overall bullish. There are, however, a few seasonal weak spots, one of them in mid-July.</p> 

<figure>
  <img src="http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-FQ069_MW_Jul_NS_20170711163002.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    
    <cite>iSPYETF</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
 <p>Seasonality for individual stocks is not a critically important factor, but it is something to keep in mind.</p> <h6>Summary</h6> <p>At the current price of around $145, Apple is above support and below resistance. A move to $135-$140 would bring Apple closer to a buy signal, while a move to $160 (or higher) would increase downside risk considerably. </p> <p>Interestingly, the S&amp;P 500, just like Apple, is in limbo now. Once the S&amp;P 500 snaps out of its range, it is likely to follow <a rel="nofollow" href="http://investorplace.com/2017/03/apple-inc-aapl-stock-is-moving-markets-literally/#.WWPlxjOZPgE"  class="icon " >the roadmap drawn by the most powerful market indicators</a>.</p> <p> <em>Simon Maierhofer is the founder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ispyetf.com/index.htm"  class="icon " >iSPYETF</a>.</em> </p>

 <p>Apple Inc. is reportedly running into issues building its next iPhone, which could hurt the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-super-cycle-hype-sends-price-target-to-177-2017-05-17" class="icon none" >“super cycle” analysts expected</a> in the fall to push the company’s biggest moneymaker back to sales growth.</p> <p>According to multiple analyst notes this week, Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 is running into issues with the fingerprint sensor, which the company has been looking to upgrade on the new iPhone. Analysts believe Apple will either delay shipments, which would presumably affect fourth-quarter financial results, or deliver the phones without the fingerprint sensor, which could hurt company unit sales and overall sales mix. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Apple has been expected to launch a new iPhone cycle in September, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-1000-iphone-could-mean-a-900-billion-market-cap-2017-05-12" class="icon none" >with three new phones</a> including a new superpremium model with an organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen and 3-D sensing capability. With that phone, Apple<a rel="nofollow" href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/29/iphone-10th-anniversary-rumors/"  class="icon " > was rumored to be moving</a> its “Touch ID” function, which currently uses a fingerprint sensor in the home button, to underneath the screen, thus eliminating the home button. </p> <p> <strong>Don’t miss: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-bets-that-youll-adopt-these-3-tech-habits-2017-06-05" class="icon none" >Apple bets that you’ll adopt these three tech habits</a></strong> </p> <p>That’s where the development issues are reportedly coming in, as Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, wrote that Apple is seeing “poor performance” through the glass. If it is not able to fix it before August, Apple may have to give up on the fingerprint technology in favor of facial recognition. But that’s not ideal. </p> <p>“While this is possible, we do not view it as attractive as it would create usability risk and would likely require shipping without initial qualification for Apple Pay, both of which could hurt unit sales and sales mix,” Hargreaves wrote. </p>

  </figcaption>

The analysts estimate that Apple now has an installed base of close to 700 million users, which is more than twice the size of its estimated base at the time of its last super cycle in 2014 with the iPhone 6. </p> <p>But even with this larger base of users, the analysts predict only 5% unit-sales growth compared with the iPhone 6 cycle, as the improved number of iPhone users looking to upgrade is offset by declining demand from first-time smartphone buyers and a decline in those users looking to switch from Alphabet Inc.’s

 <p>To comply with tough new cybersecurity rules, Apple will for the first time begin storing data for its customers in China with a government-owned company—a move that means relinquishing some control over its Chinese data.</p> <p>Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 will build its first Chinese data center in the southern province of Guizhou to house data for customers of its iCloud service. The data include photos, documents, apps and videos uploaded by Apple users throughout the mainland, the company said Wednesday.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>The center will be operated by a company owned by the Guizhou provincial government, and whose chairman was a local government official until last year.</p> <p>Under the agreement, Apple will retain control over encryption keys at the data center. It wasn’t clear if it would have access to any of the data itself, which would be overseen by its Guizhou partner.</p> <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-build-china-data-center-to-meet-new-cybersecurity-law-1499861507?mod=mktw"  class="icon " >An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</a> </p> <p> <strong>Popular on WSJ:</strong> </p>

 <p>Apple Inc.’s iTunes Store — already struggling against rising competition for music listeners — is losing the battle for video viewers as well.</p> <p>The company’s market share for renting and selling movies has been falling for several years, tumbling to between 20% and 35% from well over 50% as recently as 2012, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>No third parties track market share in the digital-movie business, making exact figures impossible to obtain. Different Hollywood studios do different amounts of business with Apple, but several of them report a marked decline in iTunes’ leadership position.</p> <p>An Apple spokeswoman, who didn’t dispute the market-share estimates, said Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
  is focused on providing customers with video content across subscription services such as Netflix 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx">(NFLX)</a>
  and Time Warner Inc.’s 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twx">(TWX)</a>
  HBO, as well as iTunes, where she said movie purchases and rentals have increased over the past year and hit their highest level in more than a decade. Apple’s growth appears to be a consequence of overall industry increases, despite its market-share losses. Last year, total U.S. digital-movie sales and rentals rose a combined 12% to $5.3 billion in the U.S., according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p> <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-itunes-falls-short-in-battle-for-video-viewers-1499601601?mod=mktw"  class="icon " >An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</a> </p>

 <p>Interest in Apple Inc.’s newest products, including the HomePod smart speaker, appears to be picking up, which could help the company gain a competitive advantage over Amazon Inc. in the sector. </p> <p>According to a Raymond James survey of 500 consumers in June, about 14% of iPhone owners intend to buy Apple’s 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
  HomePod, which, combined with those who intend to buy a Beats wireless speaker, surpasses the demand for the Amazon
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
  Echo. There is also high demand for the Apple Watch and AirPods, Apple’s wireless headphones, which could contribute more to the company’s bottom line as iPhone sales flatten. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Apple <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-unveils-smart-speaker-with-focus-on-music-as-it-battles-google-amazon-2017-06-05" class="icon none" >unveiled its HomePod </a>at its developer conference in June, but consumers won’t be able to buy it until December. The HomePod is similar in function to Amazon’s Echo -- though it’s billed as more of a smart speaker rather than a smart assistant -- but comes in at a higher price of $349 vs. $180 for the Echo. </p> <p> <strong>See also</strong>: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-bets-that-youll-adopt-these-3-tech-habits-2017-06-05" class="icon none" >Apple bets that you’ll adopt these three tech habits</a></p> <p>The report showed that 19% of consumers surveyed intend to purchase an Apple speaker, which includes iPhone users who intend to buy the Beats wireless speaker. That figure beats the 16% of consumers who intend to buy an Amazon Echo, or a related product such as the Tap or Dot. It also helps Apple surpass Bose, which had 18% of iPhone owners intending to buy its Bluetooth speaker. </p> <p>Demand is also increasing for the Apple Watch, with the 12% of consumers indicating they would buy the watch, the highest level the analysts have seen so far. It approaches demand for Fitbit Inc.
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fit">(FIT)</a>
 , which was at 12%. And while the analysts do not have numbers on AirPods, they say the demand has been greater than the supply for six months.</p>

</figure> <p>While the category including these three products makes up only about 5% of Apple’s overall revenue, the analysts said the company could continue to grow for years in this category due to the large addressable market in wearables.</p> <p>“Last quarter, driven by strong y/y trends for Apple Watch and high demand for AirPods, the category grew 31% y/y, and we suspect similar growth is likely the next several quarters,” Tavis McCourt, the lead analyst on the report, wrote in the note. </p> <p>This may be important as Apple has <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/iphone-sales-pause-and-apple-may-be-in-trouble-2017-05-02" class="icon none" >seen flattening revenue and declines</a> in the number of iPhones sold.

<description>What to do when volatility hits your stock portfolio.</description>

<h2>What to do when volatility hits your stock portfolio</h2>

 <p>While the political world has been in a state of panic since Donald Trump&apos;s election, the stock market has experienced the exact opposite. Investors have been remarkably calm &#x2014; almost weirdly so. Until recently, virtually every trading day this year has brought smallish market moves of less than a percentage point. It&apos;s gotten downright boring. </p> <p>&quot;We haven&apos;t had a 5% correction in the last 250 days or so,&quot; says Baird investment strategist William Delwiche, reflecting the longest patch of this kind of calm since the mid 1990s. This year&apos;s first-half peak-to-trough move in the S&amp;P 500 </p>
<!--ad-->



<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 was the smallest since 1995 and the second-smallest on record, he says.</p> <p>All of this is about to change. After all, if there is one sure thing about the market, it's that trends eventually revert to the mean, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Here are eight reasons why this will happen with volatility — possibly soon — and what you should do to prepare now. </p> <p> <strong>1. The market's ‘season of the witch’ is around the corner </strong> </p> <p>Historically, August is the most volatile month for stocks, says Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group, and co-portfolio manager of its Leuthold Core Investment Fund 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/lcorx">(LCORX)</a>
 .</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>This makes sense, because September and October often bring the biggest declines. Investors know this. So the August volatility could be bull vs. bear jockeying ahead of expected seasonal weakness. </p> <p> <strong>2. Investors are too complacent</strong> </p> <p>Investor complacency is now &quot;deep-seated and widespread,&quot; says Baird chief investment strategist Bruce Bittles. He cites robust cash flows into stocks, and sentiment measures revealing broad confidence. </p> <p>This might feel good if you are in stocks. But it is actually dangerous. Overly-confident investors are more likely to be shocked by negative news, as in &quot;Gee who saw that coming?!&quot; This makes them more likely to sell, when it happens. </p> <p> <strong>3. A change of the guard at the top</strong> </p> <p>Much of the 2017 market advance can be traced to the solid performance of a few mega-cap darlings. Think Amazon.com 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
 , Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
  Facebook 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
 , Alphabet 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
  and Netflix 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx">(NFLX)</a>
 . All of that changed in early June when these stocks cracked. &quot;As the market sorts through who will be in the next leadership group, that adds opportunity for volatility,&quot; says Baird’s Delwiche. </p> <p> <strong>Read:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/does-teslas-plunge-signal-the-end-for-growth-stocks-2017-07-06" class="icon none" >Does Tesla’s plunge signal the end for growth stocks?</a> </p> <p> <strong>4. The baby boomers are programmed to mess things up</strong> </p> <p>Boomers <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/baby-boomers-ruined-america-according-to-this-generation-x-author-2017-03-10" class="icon none" >get blamed </a>for a lot of things. So why not market volatility? Here's the logic: Many boomers <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/where-did-baby-boomers-go-wrong-this-generation-isnt-financially-prepared-for-retirement-2017-07-05" class="icon none" >aren't prepared for retirement</a>. Returns on cash and bonds have been excruciatingly low. So boomers have piled into stocks relative to prior generations, points out Zandi. You can see where this is going. Fearful of the proverbial cat food retirement diet, they'll pull money from stocks quickly on any decline. The upshot: Any downside stock moves will get amplified.  </p> <p> <strong>5. All that hatin' on ‘Wall Street banks’ is coming back to bite you </strong> </p> <p>Regulatory reform since the financial crisis, notably <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcker_Rule"  class="icon " >the Volcker Rule,</a> has forced the big banks to get rid of broker-dealer divisions and related trading desks. With fewer institutions making markets, there's less liquidity, and trading is thinner, says Zandi. This, too, will amplify declines when volatility strikes. Don't count on high frequency traders to pick up the slack. We all know they vanish from the market once big sell orders appear. Can you say &quot;flash crash?&quot;</p>

</figure> <p> <strong>6. Heightened geopolitical risks could boil over at any moment</strong> </p> <p>North Korea now regularly tests missiles that can reach Alaska. ISIS-inspired terror attacks are all too common. China is flexing its muscles in the waters off its coastline. European voters are rebelling against the European Union. The list of hot spots goes on and on. Underlying it all is the rolling U.S. political drama. &quot;Trump is a real wild card,&quot; says Mark DeVaul, equity portfolio manager of the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/heiix">(HEIIX)</a>
 .</p> <p> <strong>7. Fed doubters may be in for a big surprise</strong> </p> <p>Confident that growth is on track, Fed members boldly expect three rate hikes this year, three next year, and three in 2019. But a lot of investors <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-is-in-a-deep-hole-of-its-own-making-2017-06-28" class="icon none" >aren't buying it</a>. Like Pavlov's dogs, they've been trained to doubt bullish Fed expectations about economic growth. Doing so has rewarded investors betting against robust growth — as signs of weaker-than-expected growth inevitably re-emerged. </p> <p>Now, eurodollar and Fed funds futures markets suggest investors once again question the Fed's growth forecasts. Investors expect far fewer Fed rate hikes than the Fed does. &quot;This probably reflects a view that the economy’s long-run growth potential has declined a lot since the crisis,&quot; says Zandi. </p> <p>Like the Fed, though, Zandi disagrees with the nabobs of negativism on this one. Someone is wrong, and therein lies the potential for volatility. &quot;If we and the Fed are right, which seems increasingly likely given the 4.3% unemployment rate that is quickly headed lower, investors will be sorely disappointed.&quot; This will upset the markets. </p> <p> <strong>8. The market is developing a troubling split-personality</strong> </p> <p>In his seminal investing book “Stock Market Logic: A Sophisticated Approach to Profits on Wall Street,” first published in 1970s, Norman Fosback describes a useful market indicator he calls the &quot;High Low Logic Index.&quot; This indicator is deceptively simple to calculate. It's just the lesser of the following two data points for a given index: The percentage of new lows, and the percentage of new highs. </p> <p>When this number is high, it tells us that both the new lows and new highs are elevated. This is a sign of market divergence, which can be an early warning sign of greater volatility ahead. &quot;As the indices make new highs, you want to see most stocks participating,&quot; says Leuthold’s Ramsey, who brought this wonky indicator to my attention. Or as Fosback originally wrote: &quot;A healthy market requires some semblance of internal uniformity.&quot;</p> <p>What's this indicator telling us now? Since 1998, readings above 6% on the Nasdaq have presaged significant market weakness, says Ramsey. It was recently close, at 5.5%. (Like Fosback, Ramsey uses moving averages in his calculations, to smooth out the volatility in these numbers.) </p> <p> <strong>What to do now</strong> </p> <p>&quot;It would be prudent to prepare for a bumpy ride,&quot; concludes Zandi. But how? Three suggestions:</p> <p>1. If you are a long-term investor, which is probably the best approach for most people, then do nothing — other than prepare yourself psychologically to ride it out. Whatever happens that scares most investors out of stocks will be pretty scary, otherwise they wouldn't sell. So it might frighten you, too. Don't let it. </p> <p>2. If you are more of a trader, get out of dubious trades now. Get off margin. Have buying power for sharp declines in your favorite names. </p> <p>3. Consider buying portfolio insurance. Tom Clarke, co-manager of William Blair Macro Allocation Fund
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/wmcnx">(WMCNX)</a>
 has been purchasing put options, which go up in value when markets decline. Put options are cheap right now because of that eerily low volatility. &quot;It's one of the things that scares us,&quot; says Clarke. &quot;It definitely reverts to the mean at some point.&quot;</p> <p> <em>At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush suggested AMZN, GOOGL, FB and NFLX  in his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.uponstocks.com"  class="icon " >stock newsletter</a> several years ago. </em> </p>

 <p>U.S. tech stocks may be under pressure lately, but they are still the top dogs when it comes to brand power. </p> <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://brandz.com/admin/uploads/files/BZ_Global_2017_Report.pdf?link=mktw"  class="icon " >latest ranking from WPP’s Kantar Millward Brown</a> shows that the elites of the most valuable brands in the world are mostly tech companies, and overwhelmingly American.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>For the second year in a row, Google 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog">(GOOG)</a>
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
 is the most valuable brand with a price tag of $245.6 billion, followed by Apple Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 with $234.7 billion, and Microsoft Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft">(MSFT)</a>
 at $143.2 billion. Amazon.com Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
 jumped to fourth with its value soaring 41% to $139.3 billion, while Facebook Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
  retained the fifth spot for a second year with $129.8 billion and AT&amp;T Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/t">(T)</a>
 fell two notches to sixth, with a value of $115.1 billion.</p> <p>Visa Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/v">(V)</a>
 was seventh with $111 billion and Tencent Holdings Ltd. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/0700?countrycode=hk">(HK:0700)</a>
 , a Chinese internet company and the first non-U.S. name to make the top 10 list since 2013, jostled its way to eighth with $102.1 billion. Silicon Valley pioneer IBM 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ibm">(IBM)</a>
 traded places with McDonald’s Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mcd">(MCD)</a>
 moving up to ninth with $102.1 billion while the fast-food giant slipped to 10th with $97.7 billion.</p> <p>In contrast to other surveys, which measure a brand value based on a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-most-valuable-brands-in-the-world-in-one-chart-2017-02-08" class="icon none" >single criteria such as market capitalization</a>, the research firm uses several metrics for its list, including a company’s ability to persuade a consumer to choose its product and pay a premium for it.</p> <p>In 2017, the cumulative value of the top 100 brands grew 8% year-over-year to $3.6 trillion, and their stocks surged 124.9% between April 2006 and April 2017, far outstripping both the S&amp;P 500 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
  and the MSCI World Index during the same period, according to Kantar Millward Brown.</p>

 <p>In a testament to America’s soft power and economic influence, U.S. companies claimed more than half of the top 100 spots, with 54, accounting for 71% of the list’s value. </p> <p>Technology firms, including telecom providers and e-commerce companies, clearly dominated the list, checking in with 37 brands for 54% of the list’s total value. In fact, Apple and Google, the two most expensive names in the world, are together worth as much as Sweden’s economy, while the seven newcomers this year are all tech related — YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.

 <p>There is also a generational shift. Top brands are getting younger, with the average age of the big 10 falling to 42 years, from 88 in 2006.</p> <p>Only three brands have survived the ravages of time. In 2006, the top 10 were Microsoft, General Electric Co.

 <p>“The evolution of the BrandZ Global Top 10 over the past 12 years reflects the dominance of technology and the disruptive impact of the global financial crisis, technological innovation and changing consumer attitudes about health,” said Kantar Millward Brown in its report. </p> <p>Indeed, the landscape is likely to further change in the coming years, with values of brands like Tesla Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla">(TSLA)</a>
 ($5.88 billion) and Morgan Stanley

 <p>Samsung Electronics likely edged past Apple to become the world’s most profitable technology company last quarter. But to continue the strong run, it may hope the iPhone maker does better as well.</p> <p>The South Korean tech giant 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/005930?countrycode=kr">(KR:005930)</a>
 said Friday it expects its operating profit for the quarter ended June to be a record 14 trillion won ($12.1 billion)—a 72% jump from a year earlier. On the other hand, 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 will likely report an operating profit of $10.6 billion for its latest quarter when it announces results next month, according to estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>

 <p>Rising memory chip prices, driven by strong demand from servers and mobile, have likely contributed to Samsung’s strong results—the company hasn’t provided many details at this point. About 60% of its operating profit comes from the semiconductor business, according to Morgan Stanley. The March launch of its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, has also helped. Apple, on the other hand, continues to see slowing iPhone sales.</p> <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worlds-most-profitable-tech-company-not-apple-1499398067?mod=e2fb?mod=mktw"  class="icon " >An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com. </a> </p> <p> <strong>Popular on WSJ.com: </strong> </p> <p> <strong></strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/so-long-hamburger-helper-americas-venerable-food-brands-are-struggling-1499363414?mod=trending_now_4?mod=mktw"  class="icon " >So long, Hamburger Helper: America’s venerable food brands are struggling</a> </p>

<description>Nigam Arora on what the “smart money” is doing.</description>

<h2>‘Smart money’ isn’t chasing AMD and Nvidia</h2>

 <p>I have been getting a flood of requests from investors for an update on smart-money flows in popular technology stocks. </p> <p>I previously wrote about this on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-five-faamg-stocks-ranked-by-money-flows-2017-06-14" class="icon none" >June 15</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-smart-money-is-refusing-to-buy-big-tech-stocks-now-2017-06-15" class="icon none" >June 16</a>. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>The highest interest among investors is in Advanced Micro Devices 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amd">(AMD)</a>
 and 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda">(NVDA)</a>
 Both stocks have recently had several positive news triggers. However, both have pulled back in spite of that. Perhaps this is the reason for the very high interest among investors who we hear from. </p> <p> <strong>Read:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-stock-surges-to-snap-long-losing-streak-as-upbeat-data-fuels-chips-rally-2017-07-05" class="icon none" >AMD’s stock surges to snap long losing streak as upbeat data fuels chips rally</a> </p> <p>The interest level in FAAMG stocks is high but pales in comparison to that for these two. The FAAMG stocks are Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet. The popular FAANG acronym includes Netflix but not Microsoft.</p> <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://thearorareport.com/chart-money-flow-in-technology-stocks-07052017"  class="icon " >Click here to see money flows</a> in these popular technology stocks segmented by important categories, including “smart money” flows, and ranked as provided to The Arora Report subscribers. Our assessments of “smart money” flows are based on proprietary algorithms that dissect every trade and have been refined over decades.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>In general, the conclusion is that the “smart money” is not buying this dip but is instead booking some profits.</p> <p> <em>Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

</figure> <h6>Actions speak louder than words</h6> <p>Actions speak louder than words. For this reason, I will simply share with you what we are doing with these stocks. We undertook short-term trades on AMD twice. The first buy was on rumors of a big order from Apple. The trade was exited with handsome profits. The second buy came when AMD had pulled back and news came that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/six-tech-companies-getting-258m-doe-research-exascale-computing/"  class="icon " >it was selected by the Energy Department for its next-generation supercomputer architecture, called the Exascale Computing Project</a>. This trade was exited with very nice profits immediately on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-stock-falls-as-nvidias-upcoming-cryptocurrency-gpus-pose-a-threat-2017-06-28" class="icon none" >news that Nvidia is introducing a new platform for mining cryptocurrencies</a> such as bitcoin. This profit-taking was fortuitous as AMD shares fell after our exit. Both Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia compete in providing chips used to mine cryptocurrencies. </p> <p> <strong>Read:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-is-missing-how-the-bubble-in-cryptocurrencies-can-quickly-backfire-for-amd-and-nvidia-2017-06-22" class="icon none" >Bitcoin surge could backfire for AMD, Nvidia — and Wall Street can’t see the risk</a> </p> <p>We have taken profits and exited our longer-term position in Microsoft

 . </p> <p>We are still holding a long-term Apple
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
  position but our average buy price is $18.71. We are still holding Facebook
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
  long term but our average price is $49.92. For those who bought popular technology stocks for a short-term trade, we gave a sell signal on June 7, when these stocks were trading near their highs prior to the pullback. </p> <p>Our algorithms also calculate buy zones for these stocks. Currently these buy zones are below where these stocks are trading now. </p> <p>In a nutshell, we have taken some profits in technology positions but continue to hold several long-term positions. We have profitably done some short-term trades. The plan continues to be to initiate or add on dips in our buy zones for longer-term positions and undertake some short-term trades when good set ups appear. </p> <p> <em>Disclosure: Subscribers to <a rel="nofollow" href="thearorareport.com"  class="icon " >The Arora Report</a> may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.

<description>Incorrect stock data on Google Finance and Yahoo Finance appeared to be freaking out some investors Monday evening</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
    
    
    <span class="byline">By Mike Murphy</span>




<h2>Test data from Nasdaq apparently mistakenly put onto live sites</h2>

 <p>No, Amazon and Apple stock did not crash Monday. And if you held Mattel stock, you’re not suddenly rich.</p> <p>But incorrect stock data on the popular Google Finance, Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg sites appeared to be freaking out some investors Monday evening, after test data was apparently misinterpreted by third-party providers to those sites. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>As of 11 p.m. Eastern, Google Finance said Amazon.com Inc. shares were down more than 87%, to $123.47. Previously, Yahoo Finance said Amazon was down 74%, to $248.49. In reality, Amazon 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn">(AMZN)</a>
  finished the day down 1.5%, at $953.66, and was up 0.1% in after-hours trading, according to FactSet.</p> <p>Apple Inc. shares were similarly skewed, with both Google and Yahoo Finance saying they were down 14%, also to $123.47. Actually, Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 ended the day down just 0.4%, at $143.50, according to FactSet, and was up slightly in after-hours trading.</p> <p>$123.47 — or amounts close to that — appeared to be the common denominator for the test data, wildly skewing some stocks down to that level while others skyrocketed up to it. For example, the test data sent eBay Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ebay">(EBAY)</a>
  soaring 253%, Mattel Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mat">(MAT)</a>
  skyrocketing 473% and Microsoft Corp.
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft">(MSFT)</a>
  up 79%.</p> <p>Page views to MarketWatch’s stock pages — which remained accurate — soared as investors double-checked exactly what was going on Monday evening.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>A spokesman for Nasdaq put the blame on third-party data providers.</p> <p>“As part of its normal process, the UTP distributed test data and certain third parties improperly propagated the data. Nasdaq is working with third-party vendors to resolve the matter,” a Nasdaq spokesman said late Monday.</p> <p>The spokesman speculated that the day’s early close might have caused confusion with some closing prices for a number of third parties, including Bloomberg and Yahoo, but emphasized that no trades were affected by the erroneous quotes.</p> <p>Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg appeared to be showing correct ticker data as of 11 p.m. Eastern, but Google Finance was still showing the test data.</p> <p>Google’s website says Swiss-based SIX Financial Information provides end-of-day prices, and New York-based Interactive Data Real-Time Services, Inc. provides intra-day prices. Interactive Data Real-Time Services’ parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, did not immediately respond for comment. </p> <p>A Google spokesperson confirmed vie email that its third-party data service provided inaccurate information which it had received from Nasdaq, while a SIX spokesman said his company wasn’t at fault.</p> <p>“We checked with our data team — our data is correct and in no way corrupted,” the SIX spokesman said in an email.</p> <p class="editorcomment">Victor Reklaitis in London contributed to this report.</p>

 <p>Self-driving cars have always been a subject of popular debate among consumers and investors alike. But lately, the technology — and the profit potential — has started to feel very real.</p> <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/aviss-stock-soars-after-waymo-support-and-services-deal-2017-06-26" class="icon none" >This week</a>, shares of Avis Budget Group Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/car">(CAR)</a>
 surged after Alphabet Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog">(GOOG)</a>
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
 announced it will partner with the company to support and maintenance its fast-growing fleet of self-driving vehicles. Avis gets a regular paycheck for its services in the multiyear deal, and Alphabet’s Waymo arm gets access to thousands of vehicles and millions of potential customers in its effort to move forward with its autonomous driving dreams.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Waymo is way ahead of the curve in this emerging field, having recently announced <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15609844/waymo-google-self-driving-cars-3-million-miles"  class="icon " >its fleet has logged more than 3 million miles on public roads</a>. Its adorable “<a rel="nofollow" href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/13/technology/future/waymo-google-car-retired/index.html"  class="icon " >Firefly</a>” almost single-handedly brought self-driving cars out of sci-fi pages and into reality in 2014, and it has remained at the front of the field ever since.</p> <p>The laggards in the field, meanwhile, are still just testing their tech in labs and controlled settings. </p> <p>Out of all the self-driving players in the world, Alphabet (also Google’s parent) seems like a clear No. 1 to me. But who is speeding toward a self-driving future to challenge them? And who is disappointing investors and falling behind, destined to be left in the dust?</p> <p>Here’s a rundown of some of the other major players in the autonomous driving space right now, and what their outlook is:</p>
<!--ad-->


 <h6>Speeding ahead</h6> <p> <strong>Baidu</strong> </p> <p>China tech giant Baidu Inc. ADR 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/bidu">(BIDU)</a>
 is often called the “Google of China” by investors. The company has lived up to that moniker not just through its internet dominance, but also by a push into autonomous vehicles. </p> <p>Baidu won <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-baidu-autonomous-idUSKCN11L2FU"  class="icon " >approval from California to test its self-driving cars at the end of 2016</a>, in addition to older projects under way in China since as early as 2014. The company claims to be working on mass-production capabilities of its technology that will be ready for large-scale launch by 2020, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://usa.baidu.com/adu/"  class="icon " >according to its website</a>, and is already partnering with auto manufacturers and insurance companies to achieve those ends. And given Baidu’s recent announcement that it is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/baidu-will-open-source-self-driving-car-software-2017-4"  class="icon " >making its self-driving software open source</a> — just like the Android smartphone operating system that powered Google’s mobile unit a decade ago — that goal doesn’t seem unrealistic. </p>

</figure> <p> <strong>Tesla</strong> </p> <p>For me, Tesla Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla">(TSLA)</a>
 became the de facto leader in self-driving technology in 2016 after “<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/4/14/11432018/tesla-autopilot-scared-terrifying-grandmas"  class="icon " >Bill’s Mom</a>” became an internet sensation by freaking out in the driver’s seat of a Model S on Autopilot. And with its self-driving hardware including cameras and sensors coming standard on every model it produces, Tesla clearly is diving headfirst into the future of self-driving cars. </p> <p>To be clear, Autopilot is still only semiautonomous — as tragically evidenced by a recent fatal crash where <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/20/the-driver-who-died-in-a-tesla-crash-using-autopilot-ignored-7-safety-warnings/?utm_term=.740e063334a7"  class="icon " >the driver was warned seven times to put his hands on the wheel but didn’t take back control</a>. But unlike competitors that are experimenting with self-driving technology at a small scale or in controlled settings, Tesla is perhaps the company closest to a real-world rollout of truly autonomous driving technology since it is a one-stop shop and can largely go it alone.</p> <p> <strong>Read:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-happened-when-i-turned-on-teslas-autopilot-2016-07-08" class="icon none" >What happened when I turned on Tesla’s autopilot</a> </p> <h6>Cruising along</h6> <p> <strong>Honda</strong> </p> <p>While plenty of tech giants are trying to get in on autonomous cars, don’t think all traditional auto makers are just waiting to be bailed out by Silicon Valley. Honda Motor Co. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hmc">(HMC)</a>
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/7267?countrycode=jp">(JP:7267)</a>

It’s later than some of the forerunners, yes, but Honda seems to be placing a priority on caution and safety in this emerging field. That may prevent it from being first, but may ensure it has the right tech when its solutions come to market. </p>

</figure> <p> <strong>Daimler</strong> </p> <p>Most consumers think of a self-driving electric sedan when they think of what technology can offer. But Mercedes-Benz manufacturer Daimler AG 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ddaif">(DDAIF)</a>
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dai?countrycode=de">(DE:DAI)</a>
 has a much bigger plan.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mercedes-self-driving-big-rig-on-a-public-highway-2015-10"  class="icon " > Late last year, the company took an autonomous 18-wheeler on the open road</a> — a tremendous feat for its Highway Pilot technology. What’s equally impressive is that the big rig wasn’t built to be autonomous, but was simply fitted with the necessary software and hardware. </p> <p>The consumer market may be larger and perhaps more lucrative, but don’t discount the potential of being a player in the world of autonomous freight and logistics. Daimler said its gear could be ready for prime time by 2020, presuming the legal framework is in place for such technology. That could be a game changer for businesses as well as individual drivers.</p> <h6>Falling behind</h6> <p> <strong>Apple</strong> </p> <p>While Apple Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 isn’t quite as far along as Google in its self-driving-car efforts, the company did announce this week that it will partner with Hertz Global Holdings Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/htz">(HTZ)</a>
 to test autonomous technology of its own. But <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/apple-working-with-hertz-unit-to-manage-small-autonomous-fleet"  class="icon " >details show</a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000630863"  class="icon " >the deal is for a measly few SUVs</a>, hardly an impressive ramp to the half-dozen other vehicles Apple has been testing in California for the past year. </p> <p>While there has long been speculation on an Apple Car under <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-drops-hints-about-its-work-on-a-self-driving-car-2016-12-03" class="icon none" >the code name Project Titan</a>, it has become increasingly clear that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/cook-says-apple-is-focusing-on-making-an-autonomous-car-system"  class="icon " >tech giant is more focused on artificial intelligence and software</a>, despite its hardware roots. Costly overhead and a lack of tangible results have caused some investors to question whether Apple will ever deliver, and investors who have already been biting their nails over the high-stakes iPhone launch this year may not want to give Tim Cook &amp; Co. leeway on this project for much longer.</p>

While just 5% of married or committed Americans say they met their significant other online, this type of dating has surged for people of all ages, according to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/5-facts-about-online-dating/"  class="icon " >Pew Research data</a>. Today, 27% of people 18 to 24 years old use online dating, up from 10% in 2013, and 12% of 55 to 64 year olds use online dating, compared with 6% in 2013. </p> <p> <strong>See also: </strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-tinder-helps-nba-teams-win-more-games-on-the-road-2017-03-23" class="icon none" >How swiping right on Tinder helps NBA teams win more games on the road</a> </p> <p>Of course, not everyone uses these apps for <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-people-dont-use-tinder-for-love-or-sex-heres-why-they-really-use-it-2017-03-23" class="icon none" >sex or love</a>. Some singletons just want to know they’ve still got it. And other, more devout iPhone users may not even consider a date with someone who uses another type of smartphone, such <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/single-iphone-owners-dont-want-to-date-someone-with-an-android-phone-2017-02-07" class="icon none" >as the Android</a>.</p> <p> <strong>You’re always being watched</strong> </p> <p>Today, almost everyone has the potential of being watched — or caught — when they’re doing something wrong. Short videos shot on a smartphone can easily go viral, and knowing that keeps people on their toes, but also may make them less creative or increase their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/being-under-constant-surveillance-changes-our-behavior-and-not-for-the-better-2017-03-02" class="icon none" >stress levels</a>.

<description>“Baby Driver” is a action crime thriller set in a world where music drives every action. The film stars Ansel Elgort as Baby, a young getaway driver who’s constantly listening to music to drown out the hum in ears from tinnitus.</description>

<h2>Hollywood’s best-selling soundtrack of all time is Whitney Houston’s ‘The Bodyguard’ </h2>

 <p>Great music in film can alert audiences to a secret about a character that they might not otherwise discover. Music in movies can portray joy, depression. It can foreshadow a character’s fate, and in some cases, including in the just-released “Baby Driver,” it might carry the fate of the entire film.</p> <p>One of Hollywood’s most prolific composers, Hans Zimmer has said: “If you talk to any director, they’ll say music is 50% of the movie.”</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>There’s a library of classic films that use music as such a consequential part of the story that the two are linked forever, ingrained in the pages of the popular culture zeitgeist: “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” to close out “The Breakfast Club,” “Dirty Dancing’s” “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life,” “Rocky” and “Eye of the Tiger” and Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” in “The Bodyguard.”</p> <p>In Edgar Wright’s newest film “Baby Driver,” in theaters this weekend, one could argue the music has a starring role. It wouldn’t be a surprise if it had its own trailer on the lot.</p> <p>But can the film carve out a place in movie music history?</p>

</figure> <p>“Baby Driver” is a action crime thriller where music drives every action. The film stars Ansel Elgort as Baby, a young getaway driver with a talent for flair, even in tasks as simple as making sandwiches. Baby has tinnitus, so he’s constantly listening to music to drown out the hum.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>The soundtrack is the baseline to “Baby Driver” and what prompted the film. Variety aptly called it a music nerd’s dream. And in a conversation with the publication, Wright said the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion song “Bellbottoms,” which kicks off the 27-song soundtrack and first heist of the film, inspired the idea for the film.</p> <p> <strong>Check out:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/all-eyez-on-me-and-the-struggle-to-bring-tupacs-life-to-the-big-screen-2017-06-19" class="icon none" >The Tupac movie illustrates why biopics about musicians can be difficult</a> </p> <p> <strong>Also see:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hollywood-loves-the-1980s-as-much-as-it-loves-franchises-and-remakes-2017-05-26" class="icon none" >Hollywood is running out of hit ’80s movies to reboot</a> </p> <p>“I would listen to that song and imagine this car chase,” he told Variety. “The idea that started it all off was: Maybe a getaway driver is listening to this song, and he’s actually trying to time out his getaways and literally have the perfect score for the perfect score.”</p> <p>So it’s no surprise that Sony Pictures 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/sne">(SNE)</a>
 is heavily pushing the film’s soundtrack, and that it’s nearly all anyone who has seen the movie can talk about.</p> <p> <strong>Read:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/motion-pictures-academy-continues-diversity-push-inviting-dwayne-johnson-gal-gadot-and-barry-jenkins-2017-06-29" class="icon none" >Motion Pictures Academy continues diversity push, inviting Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Barry Jenkins</a> </p> <p>“A big conversation around this film is: ‘Wow you have to go see this movie because the use of music in this movie is incredible,’” said ComScore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “That could really help sustain the movie and the soundtrack.”</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></iframe> <p>The film is expected to pull in a $20.5 million return on its $34.0 million production budget in its opening weekend, according to estimates from analysts at Box Office.

  and Spotify, via Sony’s

 record label Columbia Records. As audiences fall for the music Wright curated for the film, it will be interesting to track the popularity and success of the soundtrack.</p> <p>The best-selling soundtrack of all time, according to numbers from 2016, is Whitney Houston’s “The Bodyguard.” It sold 17 million units. The second best is “Saturday Night Fever” with 15 million units, followed by “Purple Rain,” which sold 13 million units. All of the top six soundtracks sold at least 10 million albums.</p> <p>As much of a hit as “Baby Driver” and its music has been so far, however, it isn’t likely to land among the best-sold soundtracks.

All of it.</p> <p>“They didn’t really sell singles for soundtracks,” Dergarabedian said. “You used to have to buy the whole album. The studios loved it.”</p>

 <p>The iPhone is 10. How the world has changed because of it. But there are some people who have held onto their original version.</p> <p>Some first edition iPhones are more valuable than others. Bob Kraft, a retired business owner in Madison, Wisc., received an offer of $11,000 for an unopened iPhone<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-Factory-Sealed-New-Apple-iPhone-1st-Generation-8GB-Black-Smartphone-2G-/122294208523?hash=item1c794d880b:g:F9QAAOSw3mpXIOE2"  class="icon " ></a> that came in a factory gift box from Apple with a red ribbon — and he turned it down. His asking price was $15,000. “That was tempting,” he says. “But I’m not in a hurry to sell it.” He’s one of at least a dozen sellers of the 2007 iPhone who is hoping to make hay from the 10th anniversary of the iconic smartphone. He has discounted the phone from $18,000, the price he first listed it for on eBay about five months ago. He’s hoping a collector will see value in the original. “If you open it, it’s only worth a couple of bucks.”</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>The iPhone first went on sale on June 29, 2007. Some people have held onto it because they’re sentimental, while others are hoping to make thousands of dollars from their unopened first edition. Jobs announced that he would reinvent the phone and, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/steve-jobs-made-history-on-this-day-10-years-ago-2017-01-09" class="icon none" >despite skepticism from his rivals</a> and stiff competition from BlackBerry 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/bb?countrycode=ca">(CA:BB)</a>
 Apple’s 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 co-founder and former chief executive — who died in 2011 — created a multi-billion-dollar blockbuster. “An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator,” <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.european-rhetoric.com/analyses/ikeynote-analysis-iphone/transcript-2007/"  class="icon " >Jobs said at his 2007 presentation</a>. “These are not three separate devices, this is one device.” He added, “What we want do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use.” </p> 
<aside>
    ‘I do still have my original iPhone and it’s still in great working condition. It will always hold a special place in my heart.’ 
    <cite>—Brant DeBow, executive vice president of technology for BiTE interactive</cite>
</aside>
 <p>Sarah Jacobs, an associate visual features editor, refuses to recycle her 2007 iPhone and was using it up until just a couple of years ago. “Even though I’ve recycled every other iPhone I’ve owned, there’s something about the original that keeps me hanging on as though one day it might be worth money.” And it is — at least, that’s what collectors are hoping. The original, unopened 2007 iPhone <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_productid=101829149&rt=nc&_sop=15&isRefine=true&LH_BIN=1&LH_ItemCondition=1000"  class="icon " >is selling for anything from $3,500 to $20,000 on eBay</a>
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ebay">(EBAY)</a>
 Contrast this with owners of used 2007 iPhones. They sell for a meager 75 cents (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://flipsy.com/apple/iPhone+Original-AT+T-Black-16GB"  class="icon " >and resell for a paltry $1.25</a>) and, Morgan MacArthur, chief technology officer at price-comparison company Flipsy, says there’s no demand for them. (Apple did not respond to request for comment on the resale market for the original iPhone or sales of iPhone 7.)</p> <p> <strong>Don’t miss:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-amazons-first-ever-customer-2015-04-22" class="icon none" >Meet Amazon’s first customer</a> </p> <p>Ten years is a long time in smartphone technology. The first generation iPhone, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09Apple-Reinvents-the-Phone-with-iPhone.html"  class="icon " >which cost $499 for a 4-gigabtye model and $599 for an 8-gigabyte model</a>, was a major upgrade for people using flip phones. Those flips could text, email and access the internet, but not do much more than that. The 2007 iPhone also has a shorter battery life, less sophisticated camera, is not hot-wired for the faster 4G wireless networks, does not play many new apps and does not have Siri, the voice-activated search engine. And yet some folk are unwilling to part with it. “I do, in fact, still have my original iPhone and it’s still in great working condition,” says Brant DeBow, executive vice president of technology for BiTE interactive. “It will always hold a special place in my heart because it was the phone that kicked off our company.” (His company makes apps.) He recently bought an iPhone 7, although his favorite video game is only available on his 2007 version.</p>

Last year, Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said, “iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus dramatically improve every aspect of the iPhone experience, reaching a new level of innovation and precision to make this the best iPhone we have ever made.” Sound familiar? In 2013, he hailed the iPhone 5S as “the most forward-thinking phone we have ever created.” He said as much about the iPhone 5: “Never before have we built a product with this extraordinary level of fit and finish.” Before that, the iPhone 4S was called “the most amazing iPhone yet.” And before that, the iPhone 4 was, to quote Jobs, “the most beautiful thing we have ever made.” </p> <p>But upgrading to older models and slower growth in the iPhone 6S has caused a slowdown in Apple revenue, analysts say. Last May, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/iphone-sales-pause-and-apple-may-be-in-trouble-2017-05-02" class="icon none" >Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook made a rare acknowledgment </a>that customers were delaying iPhone purchases serves as a warning that iPhone sales could continue to lag for a second straight year. Kevin Rieffel, an attorney who lives near Philadelphia, is one customer who still has his original 2007 iPhone in a desk drawer, but has so far resisted the lure of the iPhone 7. “I’ve upgraded at least once since 2014 to the 64GB iPhone 6 Plus,” he says. “I’m partial to the bigger screen, faster wireless data and better battery life.”</p> <p>For Apple aficionados like Rieffel, the 2007 iPhone may not be the smartest or fastest, but it’s still the best.</p>

<h2>Google parent Alphabet is the top holding of the Red Oak Technology Select Fund</h2>

 <p>How would you react to a 39% gain in a particular stock over the past 12 months? Would you suggest selling it to lock in the gain? </p> <p>Mark Oelschlager, the portfolio manager for the Red Oak Technology Select Fund 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/rogsx">(ROGSX)</a>
 doesn’t think this way at all, and he has a very solid track record standing behind his continued faith in Alphabet, Google’s parent company.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Despite that 39% increase in both Alphabet Inc.‘s Class A 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl">(GOOGL)</a>
 and Class C 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog">(GOOG)</a>
 shares, Oelschlager described both stocks as still “compelling.” He cited Alphabet’s 17% increase in first-quarter revenue and said, “the stock is right around a 5% free cash yield, which is roughly where the market is and might even be better.”</p> <p>A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after capital-spending commitments. This is money that can be used for any corporate purpose, including acquisitions or other expansion. If you divide a company’s annual free cash flow per share by its share price, you have the free cash flow yield, which can be used for comparison</p> <p>The two Alphabet share classes together made up 8.1% of the Red Oak Technology Select Fund as of March 31, by far the fund’s largest equity position.</p> <p>The fund was ranked 17th of 7,581 actively managed open-ended mutual fund, based on average total returns for five years, through June 26, according to data provided by Morningstar. It has $460 million in assets and was established in December 1998. Oelschlager, who is Oak Associates Funds’ co-chief investment officer, took over as the fund’s portfolio manager in April 2006. Before joining Oak Associates in 2000, he was an equity analyst for the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the fund’s performance has stacked up against its peer group, according to Morningstar, as well as the S&amp;P 500 technology sector and the Guggenheim S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/ryt">(RYT)</a>

But it stands out even among its peers. Among 51 actively managed U.S.open-ended technology funds — which excludes narrowly focused funds, such as those that only buy semiconductor stocks, for example — the Red Oak Technology Select Fund ranked third over the past five years.</p> <p> <strong>Also see:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-1-mutual-fund-which-made-a-killing-off-amazon-and-tesla-is-now-focused-on-these-stocks-2017-06-19" class="icon none" >No. 1 mutual fund, which made a killing off Amazon and Tesla, is now focused on these stocks</a> </p> <p>Oelschlager said free cash flow yield and price-to-earnings valuations are important parts of his team’s stock selection, but that he also is concerned with the “sustainability” of a business.“</p> <p>Many tech investors “think they need to find the big stars of the future,” he told MarketWatch in a June 28 interview, but the odds of identifying the next Google or Facebook “are against you.” </p> <p>“When you focus on companies growing the fastest, the deck again is stacked against you because of high valuations,” he added.</p>

 <p>Another stock Oelschlager is keen on is KLA-Tencor Corp. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/klac">(KLAC)</a>
 which makes equipment for the semiconductor industry. Valuation is the reason: free cash flow is about 6% and the shares trade for 15.9 times the consensus 2018 earnings estimate among analysts polled by FactSet. That compares with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.1 for the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector and of 16.5 for the entire S&amp;P 500 index 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
</p> <p>KLA-Tencor’s valuation looked especially low because it “dominates” its industry niche, he said. “Granted, it is a cyclical, and does not necessarily deserve a high multiple, but they have proven to be fairly consistent and the stock looks like a good long-term investment,” he added.</p> <p>One position Oelschlager has “cut back quite a bit” is chip maker Nvidia Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda">(NVDA)</a>
 after it returned 227% during 2016. </p> <h6>Low turnover</h6> <p>According to Morningstar, the fund’s annual turnover ratio has been 6%, which is amazingly low for an actively managed fund. This underscores Oelschlager’s style of sticking with companies showing consistently high rates of growth. </p> <p>“A lot of people are tempted to trade a lot, because it feels like you are accomplishing something by constantly making moves. But often times, the best thing is to do nothing,” he said. </p> <p>However, the fund will be much more active during periods of disruption in the market, he said. During 2009, for example, the fund’s turnover was 30%. That was in the wake of the credit crisis that sent the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector down 43% in 2008.</p> <h6>Fund holdings</h6> <p>Here are the Red Oak Technology Select Fund’s 10 largest stock holdings (out of 42), as of March 31.

 <p>Goldman Sachs is coming around on the economy’s prospects, though it isn’t quite bullish.</p> <p>The investment bank, which <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-may-be-banking-too-much-on-trump-lifting-earnings-2017-02-22" class="icon none" >has for months been warning</a> that U.S. stock market gains have occurred against a backdrop of falling earnings expectations, is raising its forecasts, painting an improved picture of what the second half of the year might look like. While it continues to expect the S&amp;P 500 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 will end 2017 below current levels, it sees greater contributions from both the financial and technology sectors, the latter of which has led the market higher thus far this year, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-internet-stocks-hit-records-familiar-questions-about-bubbles-arise-2017-05-22" class="icon none" >despite persistent concerns about valuations</a>.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>David Kostin, the firm’s chief U.S. strategist, raised his year-end target for the S&amp;P to 2,400 from 2,300. The higher target is about 1.6% below current levels.</p> <p>“The prospect of accelerating inflation, higher policy rates, and rising 10-year bond yields will weigh on S&amp;P 500 valuation,” the team of analysts wrote in a note to clients. “We expect earnings per share growth of 9% this year will be offset by a 4% contraction in the forward price-to-earnings multiple to 17.3 from 18.1.” Goldman forecast GDP growth of 2.1% in 2017, along with average yields of 2.6% for the U.S. 10-year Treasury note 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx">(BX:TMUBMUSD10Y)</a>
 which is currently at 2.23%.</p> <p> <strong>Related:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-donald-trump-boosting-the-economy-goldman-finds-mixed-signals-2017-05-12" class="icon none" >Is Donald Trump boosting the economy? Goldman finds mixed signals</a> </p> <p>The relatively improved outlook comes amid growing profit expectations, and in addition to its higher target for the benchmark index, Goldman also raised its forecast for S&amp;P earnings, to $129 a share from $123 in 2017, and to $139 from $129 a share for 2018. “The increase stems from strong first-quarter results and higher expected growth in Financials and Info Tech,” it wrote, reiterating its overweight positions on those sectors, which expects to grow earnings by 13% (financials) and 9% (tech).</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>The mean estimate of analysts polled by FactSet suggests 2017 earnings of $131.73 a share. This is down from the $135.25 a share estimate that was forecast at the end of April, though it is up from the December consensus view of $129.42 a share. </p> <p>Goldman had previously been cautious on the market’s earnings picture. In February, it wrote that equities were “approaching the point of maximum optimism” and that “financial market reconciliation lies ahead,” referring to the divergence between profit forecasts and share-price gains. This was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-profit-expectations-drop-goldman-sachs-says-stock-rally-may-hit-the-brakes-2017-05-15" class="icon none" >followed by another warning in May</a>, when it wrote that “history strongly suggests that at some point this year investors will have to digest negative revisions to fourth-quarter earnings per share estimates.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, Goldman wrote that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-says-stock-markets-goldilocks-environment-wont-last-long-2017-06-12" class="icon none" >markets were in a “Goldilocks scenario”</a> that was unlikely to persist over the long term, and the expectation that markets will end the year below current levels suggests this still the cast.</p> <p>“We recommend investors focus on companies with strong secular growth and margin expansion prospects,” Kostin’s team wrote, explicitly naming Facebook Inc.

 <p>If Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. want to succeed in TV they’re going to need money and audience. </p> <p>Good thing for them, they have both.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Competition in the TV landscape is already intense, and now Facebook 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb">(FB)</a>
 is reportedly wining and dining Hollywood studios and talent agencies with the aim of producing original television programming.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-is-going-hollywood-seeking-scripted-tv-programming-1498388401"  class="icon " >reported</a> that the social media giant has held meetings with talent agencies, in which Facebook has said it’s willing to spend as much as $3 million per episode. That’s less than Netflix Inc. 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx">(NFLX)</a>
 but more than Time Warner Inc.’s 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twx">(TWX)</a>
 HBO spends per episode on average.</p> <p> <strong>Don’t miss:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-has-to-cancel-shows-because-not-even-it-can-keep-spending-like-this-2017-06-12" class="icon none" >Netflix adds ‘Girlboss to the dump pile as its content production goals mature</a> </p> <p>Also, Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 has shown it’s serious about its desire to be a major content player. The company recently lured Sony Pictures Television executives Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht away from the studio where they oversaw such series as “Breaking Bad,” “Better Call Saul” and “The Crown.”</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>While Apple <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-annual-apple-cash-bonanza-is-here-will-300-billion-be-enough-2017-05-02" class="icon none" >doesn’t exactly have $250 billion in cash</a> to wave around, it certainly has the money to attract the talent it would take to deliver quality content.</p> <p>The willingness and ability to spend exorbitantly to secure the best content is the only thing standing between Facebook, Apple and success, said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield.</p>

    <h1>Facebook Launches New Augmented-Reality Technology</h1>
    <cite>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday at the company&#39;s annual F8 developers’ conference that the social-media giant would make its augmented-reality tools, which mix digital and physical spaces, available to third-parties to create custom masks, filters and other effects. Early partners include Nike Inc., Electronic Arts Inc. EA and Warner Bros. Photo: Zuma Press</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure> <p>“There’s a ton of wallet out there and a ton of watch time,” Greenfield said. “I think this is just the beginning. The question is are these companies going to spend the kind of money necessary to have quality content.”</p> <p>Apple has the money and it makes sense with the company’s distribution of other entertainment. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said there’s a clear path to Apple enticing consumers to pay for their original content.</p> <p> <strong>See:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-has-taken-its-first-steps-in-original-content-2017-02-14" class="icon none" >Apple has taken its first step in original content</a> </p> <p>“That’s a natural extension of what Apple does,” Pachter said. “But I’m not sure what the end game for Facebook is.”</p> <p>Facebook’s attraction is its audience and the data it has on them. Facebook boasts nearly 2 billion monthly users and all the company wants is for as many of those users as possible to engage with content on the platform. Facebook has already been able to parade its audience and ink deals with Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball to air games.</p> <p> <strong>Also read:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/googles-big-european-fine-is-likely-bad-news-for-facebook-amazon-and-others-2017-06-27" class="icon none" >Google’s big European fine is likely bad news for Facebook, Amazon and others</a> </p> <p>Facebook’s video aspirations probably won’t look like the most others in the landscape. Pachter said the social platform probably won’t turn toward a subscription service. He points out that if Facebook prominently featured original series on users’ timelines and only 1% of them actually watched the shows, that’s two million viewers.</p> <p>That’s a fraction of the number of eyeballs garnered by a lot of TV’s most-watched programing, but Pachter said it’s likely more than the number watching a lot of the series on Netflix and at $3 million an episode that has potential for a solid return on investment.</p> <p>Shares of Facebook have gained nearly 33% in the year to date, while Apple shares have gained close to 26%. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">(SPX)</a>
 is up 9% in the year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia">(DJIA)</a>
 is up more than 8%.</p>

 <p>A U.S. federal judge ruled against Qualcomm Inc.’s motion to dismiss a Federal Trade Commission case arguing that the large supplier of smartphone chips used its position in the market to compete unfairly.</p> <p>The Monday ruling by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh is a setback—though not an unexpected one—in Qualcomm’s 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/qcom">(QCOM)</a>
 broad legal battle over its business practices. That fight includes a separate lawsuit filed by Apple Inc.
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
  against Qualcomm which makes legal arguments similar to the U.S. government’s.</p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Judge Koh’s decision that the government’s case could move forward rejected Qualcomm’s claim, filed in April in a Northern California federal district court, that the FTC’s complaint failed to support even basic elements of an antitrust violation.</p> <p>The FTC says Qualcomm, whose technology is used in almost all smartphones, acts unfairly by refusing to sell its chips to handset makers who don’t buy a license to use its patents—which are deemed essential to cellular communications—and by refusing to sell licenses to competing chip makers. The government says Qualcomm further impaired competition by using its dominant position to compel Apple to use its chips exclusively.</p> <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-denies-qualcomm-motion-to-dismiss-ftcs-competition-lawsuit-1498541099"  class="icon " >An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com</a>.</p> <p> <strong>Popular on WSJ.com:</strong> </p>

 <p>Imagination Technologies Group PLC has put itself up for sale and is talking with potential bidders, after its shares lost more than half their value as Apple Inc. dropped the chip supplier.</p> <p>The British tech company 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/img?countrycode=uk">(UK:IMG)</a>
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ignmf">(IGNMF)</a>
 — which designs the iPhone and iPad’s graphics chip — said Thursday that in recent weeks it has “received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition” of the whole group and “therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process.” It also said it is in early discussions with interested suitors. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>Shares of Imagination soared 17% to £1.44 after the news on Thursday.</p> <p>The company’s stock plunged 62% to £1.030 on April 3, after Imagination revealed that Apple 
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl">(AAPL)</a>
 planned to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/imagination-technologies-shares-tank-72-after-apple-pulls-chip-contract-2017-04-03" class="icon none" >stop using its technology in new products</a> within two years’ time. That means Imagination would not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement with the California-based iPhone maker.</p>

 <p>“Apple accounts for about half [Imagination’s] revenues, and the drop in the share price on the day of the announcement was one of the biggest on record for a mid or large-cap company, wrecking its market cap and forcing it to do all it could to shore up cash,” said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. </p> <p>Wilson pointed out that Imagination had to tried to selloff two of its three main businesses — MIPS and Ensigma — to strengthen the balance sheet, but without success. </p>
<!--ad-->


 <p>“These were both strong potential growth areas that could have delivered lasting revenue accretion to offset the loss of Apple,” he said. </p> <p>“That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer. Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story,” he added. </p> <p>Imagination’s shares closed at £1.235 on Wednesday, meaning they were still down 54% since the announcement about the contract loss in April.</p> <p>Apple has been working on an independent in-house graphics chip architecture with the potential to reduce the need for Imagination technology in future iPhones, the British company has said. But it has questioned the iPhone maker’s ability to create an independent chip design without infringing on Imagination’s intellectual property rights, raising the prospect of a legal battle.</p> <p>“Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new [graphics processor unit] architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights,” the company said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>The chip designer said on Thursday “it remains in dispute with Apple” after being unable to reach an agreement.</p> <p>Apple shares were down 0.4% early in Thursday’s trade. </p>
